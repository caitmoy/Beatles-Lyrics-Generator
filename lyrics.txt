 # what goes on in your heart, #  what goes on in your mind. #  you are tearing me a part #  when you treat me so unkind, #  what goes on in your mind. #  the other day I saw you as I walked along the road, #  but when I saw him with you I could feel my future fold, #  it's so easy for a girl like you to lie, #  tell me why. #  what goes on in your heart, #  what goes on in your mind. #  you are tearing me a part #  when you treat me so unkind, #  what goes on in your mind. #  I met you in the morning waiting for the tides of time, #  but now the tide is turning I can see that I was blind, #  it's so easy for a girl like you to lie, #  tell me why. #  what goes on in your heart, #  I used to think of no one else #  but you were just the same, #  you didn't even think of me #  as someone with a name, #  did you mean to break my heart #  and watch me die, #  tell me why. #  what goes on in your heart, #  what goes on in your mind. #  you are tearing me a part #  when you treat me so unkind, #  what goes on in your mind. #  in your mind, in your mind. # 
 # look what you're doing #  I'm feeling blue and lonely #  would it be too much to ask of you #  what you're doing to me #  you got me running #  and there's no fun in it #  why should it be so much to ask of you #  what you're doing to me #  I've been waiting here for you #  wond'ring what you're gonna do #  should you need a love that's true it's me. #  please stop your lying #  you got me crying girl #  why should it be so much to ask of you #  what you're doing to me. #  what you're doing to me. # 
 # yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away #  now it looks as though they're here to stay #  oh I believe in yesterday #  suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be #  there's a shadow hanging over me #  oh yesterday came suddenly #  why she had to go I don't know #  she wouldn't say #  I said something wrong now I long for yesterday #  yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away #  now it looks as though they're here to stay #  oh I believe in yesterday #  why she had to go I don't know #  she wouldn't say #  I said something wrong now I long for yesterday #  yesterday love was such an easy game to play #  now I need a place to hide away #  oh I believe in yesterday #
