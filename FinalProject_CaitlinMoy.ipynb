    "## Introduction\n",
    "For my Computational Linguistics final project, I created a Beatles Lyrics Generator. I included concepts from class including a bigram model with weighted probabilities as well as regular expressions to filter out text. For the front-end, I implemented a simple chat bot to interact with the user. In this notebook, I walk through the steps I took to complete the program.\n",

    "## Step 1: Selecting the Corpora\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than using a corpora of all songs recorded by the Beatles, I wanted to focus on songs officially accredited to the songwriting duo \"Lennon/McCartney,\" responsibile for the Beatles trademark sound and most of their repertoire. In addition, I chose to only use songs written between 1962 and 1966. This time period spans the years from when the band first started their career to the mid-sixties, when they underwent a significant style shift. Because their songs in the early sixties mostly center around the theme of love, while their songs in the late sixties vary greatly in topics and choice in words, the band's earlier material made for a better candidate for coherent results. \n",

Regular expressions were also used to make stylistic changes to the text. I changed \"wo\" to \"woah\", \"yeh\" to \"yeah\", and capitalized \"i\" purely for preference, and to help the lyrics read more naturally. After each song was formatted, it was written as a string to the \"lyrics.txt\" file created earlier. "

    "After running the program several times, I found that the output sometimes resembles that of a song, but isn't always perfectly coherent. It is difficult to replicate the songwriting finesse of the Beatles, but the output doesn't exactly seem as if it was written by a sane person. A different model might yield better results. In addition, the fact that my model doesn't account for rhyming or rhythm, two key components in songwriting, might explain the wacky output. \n",
    "However, the output does generally maintain the themes of love songs, and has produced some coherent and original lines. In addition, it does a good job of maintaining the \"yeah, yeah, yeah\" and \"ooh, ooh\" phrases which lend themselves well to bigrams and repitition. Here are some of my favorite results:\n",
